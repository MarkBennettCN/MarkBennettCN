- 👋 Hi, I’m @MarkBennettCN
- 👀 I’m interested in Platform Engineering, reducing bottlenecks and single points of failure, improving Developer Experience, and generally making the lives of Developers more productive (making it easier for EVERYONE to get work done together)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Golang
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on enabling and empowering each other
- 📫 How to reach me: Slack, [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bennema1/)
- ⚡ Fun fact: I co-organize the Platform and DevOps Engineering Meetup of Hampton Roads (PlaDo) with [RyanRennCN](https://github.com/RyanRennCN). I enjoy connecting with other people and learning/sharing experiences so that we can all benefit and make our lives easier or, at least, less difficult
